# Irreal Engine
[Irreal Engine](https://github.com/albertmas/GameEngines) is a 3D game engine created by [Albert Mas](https://github.com/albertmas/) and [Guillem Arman](https://github.com/GuillemArman) for the Game Engines university subject at [UPC-CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/).

## Work done
**2nd Assignment**

Albert: Engine Structure, Mesh Binary Format, GameObject Hierarchy & Inspector, Imoprter, Components Transform, Mesh and Texture; Serialization, In-Game Assets Folder

Guillem: Component Camera, Quadtree

## For the development of this engine, we have used the following libraries:
- [DeviceId](https://github.com/MatthewKing/DeviceId) Version Deceber 2015:
Used to detect hardware
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) Version 1.66 WIP:
Used to create the UI
- [MathGeoLib](https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib) Version 2.0:
Used to get math functions and geometric functions
- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) Version 2.0.8:
Used in Graphic rendering and Input detection
- [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/) Version 0.9 (Minimal C Implementation):
Random number generator
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) Version 4.6.0:
API used to interact with the GPU to render graphics
- [RapidJSON](http://rapidjson.org/index.html) Version 1.1.0:
Fast JSON parcer/generator
- [GLEW](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew) Version 2.0.0:
OpenGL exension library that determines which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform
- [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) Version 3.3.0:
Used to load FBX meshes
- [DevIL](http://openil.sourceforge.net/) Version 1.8.0:
Used to load textures
- [MMGR](http://www.paulnettle.com/)
Used to track memory leaks

## Innovation
**1st Assignment:** We have created a file explorer that can search files in the hard drive and then, if they are a mesh (.FBX) or an image (.dds, .png, .jpg) load them.
